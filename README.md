Initially, `src` attribute of `img` tag is set to `/invalid-image.png` which will result in `404`.

`setupSecureMedia`: This script patches original src setter of image with a custom setter which replaces invalid images urls with valid urls. To handle ssr images we are querying all the `img` elements present in the dom (will be part of initial html) and trigger a src set (img.src = img.src).

This works fine for dynamically added images but won't work for the img tags present in initial html generated by server side rendering.

**Cons**

1. Even though we are replacing the invalid image URLs with the valid ones, the browser will still initiate the network call for the invalid image URL before our script runs.

## Getting Started
